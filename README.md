# Tasklist

This is my first real attempt at python programming. It's a work in progress. MVP has not been achieved.

-Last Change: Changed match/case to if/elif
-Next Change: Implement custom functions to reduce repetitive code
-Next next change: Build a GUI, realize how much the program sucks, then update program.
